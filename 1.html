  <strong>The Catholic faith was firjst brought to the North American continent by the <u>Spanish</u> in the 1500s.</strong>
  For the next 300 years, Catholic missionaries and settlers from Spain and then Latin America came to what is now California and the Southwest.
  Many of the cities were named by these missionaries and settlers San Francisco, Santa Fe, and San Antonio, for example.</p><p style="margin-top:40px;">Frefich Canadian Catholic missionaries also came with the explorers and traders from Quebec, down the Mississippi River to New Orleans.
  In the 1600s, the European settlers began establishing colonies.along the east coast of North America.
  Although there were some Catholics

  , the vast majority of the European settlers were Protestants, most from England.
  As the new nation formed, it was the Protestant branch of the Christian faith that had the strongest
  effect on the development of the religious climate in the United States.</p>
